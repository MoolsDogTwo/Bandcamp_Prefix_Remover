## About
Are you sick of having to browse downloaded Bandcamp songs with those annoying, long prefixes? This program aims to solve that issue.

### Troubleshooting
#### Why isn't it working?
Bandcamp formats album names with characters such as a comma to a dash. This can create problems as the song titles don't convert this way. So make sure to rename the folder itself the song prefix to prevent any issues!
